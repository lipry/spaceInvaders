/*BattleField is a class describing the battlefield (that is to say, the game screen). It
can be broadly described as a matrix: every element of this matrix will contain an alien,
a gun, a shot, a casemate or will be empty. An instance of BattleField represents a
snapshot of the current battlefield configuration.*/

should possibly throw: the implementer will have to carefully judge when the former
have to be implemented.*/
